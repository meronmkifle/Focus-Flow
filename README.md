# Focus-Flow
A Pomodoro timer is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique, which breaks work into focused intervals usually 25 minutes of work followed by a 5-minute break. After a few cycles, you take a longer break. It helps improve focus, manage time effectively, and prevent burnout.

**Focus Flow** – a simple Pomodoro timer to help you stay productive and take proper breaks. There are plenty of similar tools online, but I prefer having a simple, ad-free, and completely free option like this one !
